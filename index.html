                Open City Design is a project that aims to create accessible and inclusive cities for everyone. We believe that design can play a crucial role in making cities more livable and welcoming for people with disabilities, the elderly, and other marginalized groups.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our approach is to collaborate with city planners, architects, and other stakeholders to identify the barriers that prevent people from accessing public spaces and services. We then work to develop design solutions that address these barriers and make cities more accessible and inclusive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our work is guided by the principles of universal design, which emphasizes designing products and spaces that can be used by people of all abilities and ages. We believe that by creating more accessible and inclusive cities, we can improve the quality of life for everyone.
              </p>
              <p>
                Join us in our mission to create a more inclusive and accessible world, one city at a time.
