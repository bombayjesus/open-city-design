## So, how do you make cities more liveable? We have some fun ideas,

* Green spaces and urban agriculture: Prioritize the creation and maintenance of green spaces, such as parks and gardens, that provide opportunities for outdoor recreation and relaxation. Promote urban agriculture initiatives that allow citizens to grow their own food and foster a sense of community.

* Community engagement: Systems for fostering community engagement and participation in city planning and decision-making. This can include regular public meetings, online forums, and other channels for citizens to provide input and feedback on city projects and policies.

* Mental health and well-being: Prioritize mental health and well-being by promoting access to resources such as counseling services, mindfulness classes, and meditation spaces. Mental health awareness campaigns and initiatives that promote stress reduction and self-care.

* Accessibility and inclusivity: Include systems for promoting accessibility and inclusivity for all citizens, including those with disabilities or from marginalized communities. Initiatives include accessible public transportation, affordable housing, and cultural events that celebrate diversity and promote inclusion.
